Welcome to my Mushroom Classification Web App!
This app is designed to help you detect whether a mushroom is poisonous or not by simply loading a photo. 

As a data scientist, I have developed a machine learning model that is capable of accurately classifying mushrooms into their respective categories based on their visual features. 

With this web app, you can easily upload a photo of a mushroom and have it classified instantly. Whether you are a mushroom forager or simply curious about the mushrooms in your backyard, this app is a reliable tool to help you make safe decisions. 

So, go ahead and give it a try!
